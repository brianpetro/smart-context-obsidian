# Smart Context

**Feed large language models better inputs, faster.** **Smart Context *collects, cleans, and copies* every note you need** in a single click.

> [!NOTE] Why does context matter?
> AI only answers as well as the context you provide. Smart Context helps aggregate scattered notes into templated snippets that can be quickly pasted into ChatGPT, so your prompts hit harder, your responses feel clairvoyant, and your flow state stays unbroken.

✔️ Zero‑setup: works out‑of‑the‑box  
🔐 Local‑first & privacy‑preserving
🤖 Compatible with any AI workflow  
⚔️ Mission‑driven, community‑supported

## Mission‑driven

The Obsidian community proved user‑aligned software can out‑innovate closed platforms. Smart Context embodies that spirit—open‑source tools that **empower individuals**, not gatekeepers. Read about the [Smart Principles](https://smartconnections.app/smart-principles/) that guide development.

## Private by Design

No data leaves your vault unless *you* copy it. All parsing, filtering, and token estimates run locally. Use local embedding models or remote APIs—it is your choice.

## Core Features

* **Copy folder contents**  
  Grab every Markdown and Canvas file inside a folder—including sub‑folders—and render a tree + fenced code blocks.

* **Copy visible open files**  
  Only the notes you can currently see are included. Perfect for quick Q&A sessions.

* **Copy all open files**  
  Snapshot *every* tab—great for large refactors or brainstorming sessions.

* **Exclude headings**  
  Add glob patterns (e.g. `*Secret*`, `Confidential`) and those sections vanish before copy.

* **Context Builder UI**  
  A modal lets you mix folders, individual notes, backlinks, outlinks, and AI‑discovered connections into one curated context bundle.

* **Token / char estimator**  
  Live stats help you stay under model limits before you hit *Copy*.

---

## Settings

* **Excluded Headings** – Glob patterns to strip (no regex fiddling required).  
* **In‑links / Out‑links** – Include backlinks or only forward links.  
* **Before / After Context** – Custom banners, file trees, or dividers.  
* **Before / After Each Item** – Template strings like `{{ITEM_PATH}}` or `{{ITEM_DEPTH}}`.  

---

## Advanced Workflows

* **Context Selector**  
  Set a hotkey → *Context selector* to quickly cherry‑pick notes, folders, or AI‑suggested connections without leaving the keyboard.

* **Smart Chat Integration**  
  Smart Context powers the context in **Smart Chat**: drag items, auto‑retrieve with pronouns, review before send.

* **Scripting & Automations**  
  All compile options are exposed via `ctx.compile({ link_depth, templates })`, ready for Templater, DataviewJS, or shell scripts.

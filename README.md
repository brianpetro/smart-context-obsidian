# Smart Context

**Feed large language models better inputs, faster.** **Smart Context *collects, cleans, and copies* every note you need** in a single click.

> [!NOTE] Why does context matter?
> AI only answers as well as the context you provide. Smart Context helps aggregate scattered notes into templated snippets that can be quickly pasted into ChatGPT, so your prompts hit harder, your responses feel clairvoyant, and your flow state stays unbroken.

✔️ Zero-setup: works out-of-the-box
🔐 Local-first and privacy-preserving
🤖 Compatible with any AI workflow
⚔️ Mission-driven, community-supported

## Mission-driven

The Obsidian community proved user-aligned software can out-innovate closed platforms. Smart Context embodies that spirit—open-source tools that **empower individuals**, not gatekeepers. Read about the [Smart Principles](https://smartconnections.app/smart-principles/) that guide development.

## Private by Design

No data leaves your vault unless *you* copy it. All parsing, filtering, and token estimates run locally. Use local embedding models or remote APIs—it is your choice.
